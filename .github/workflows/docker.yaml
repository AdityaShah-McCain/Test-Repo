# we can configure a job to run in a docker container or we can also configure a step to run in a docker 
# container
# if we want to run our job in a container, we have to run the job in a linux machine (ubuntu)

jobs:
  docker-job:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    # container: node:23-alpine3.20 # if you are using dockerhub, image_name:tag
    # if your image lives in another registry, then you just need to add something before for ex
    # docker://node:18.16-alpine3.17
    container: # we are specifying the docker image for the entire job
      image: node:23-alpine3.20
    #   credentials: # we have to do this if we using a private image, in our case the image is public
    #     username:
    #     password:
      env: # environment variables
        API_URL: some-url.com
      ports: # array of ports that we expose to the docker container
        - 80
    #   volumes: # three types of volumes (we don't have these paths in reality so we are commenting it)
    #     - vol_name:/path/in/container # this is a named volume
    #     - /path/in/container # unnamed (anonymous) volume
    #     - /path/in/host:/path/in/container # path in host machine mapped to path in container
    #   options: --cpus 1 # options are any options that you can post to the Docker Create command except network and entry point
    steps: # these steps won't directly run on the runner machine, it will run inside the container
